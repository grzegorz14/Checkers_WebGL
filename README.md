# Checkers_WebGL

Web GL project on Stefa≈Ñczyk classes.
Code is not optimized bacause in the moment I'm working on several other projects and don't have time to do everything very carefully.

To start the project:
  - npm install
  - npm start
 
Server runs on port 3000. 

You need 2 clients to play. 

Game rules and changes:
  1. Start with regular checkers rules
  2. You aren't forced to beat opponent's pawns
  3. Beating doesn't give you additional moves
  4. Queen may move one field in any direction
  5. Being unable to move means that you lose
